## Quest Engine

## Description

An Angular compatible NodeJS library for the use with [Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) that allows to create and participate in quests on the network.

We have chosen Angular/Electron as an example environment because we believe it offers the best accessibility for developers coming from any other language/framework. It is already being used in Python on PyQt5 and we aim to provide the underlying library in Go and wherever possible in Rust as well.

[qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk) works in the browser, as an Electron on Windows, Mac and Linux and Android using Cordova.

[Quest OS](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-os-js) uses [4096 Bit RSA-OAEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Operation) encryption, [256 Bit AES-CBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption and [NIST P-521 EC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography#Fast_reduction_(NIST_curves)) signatures.

## Development

### Planning 

See our [Kanban](https://github.com/orgs/QuestNetwork/projects/1) for the development of 0.9.4, feel free to add or pick up features!

### Building

qDesk Social is a module of [qDesk](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk), so please see https://github.com/QuestNetwork/qDesk#development for instructions.

### Commands

**Prepare Package**

``npm run inst`` Removes `package-lock.json` and runs ``npm install``

We added an example ```swarm.json``` to the ```src/app``` folder with an example node to make reproduction easier, but we strongly recommend to use our [Quest CLI](https://github.com/QuestNetwork/quest-cli) to test and build the app.

Pro Tip: Put a file in your `/bin` that runs the quest-cli like so `node /path/to/quest-cli/index.js` from any folder on your system. It's much nicer!
